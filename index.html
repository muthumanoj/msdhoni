    <p>
      <b>Mahendra Singh Dhoni</b> (born 7 July 1981), commonly known as M. S.
      Dhoni and *Mahi*, is a cricket player and was the former captain of the
      Indian cricket team. Dhoni is a right-handed batsman. He is known as the
      greatest captain of all time, having achieved more success than any other
      captain in the history of cricket. The Indian cricket team won the 2011
      Cricket World Cup under his captainship. His Test cricket and One Day
      International records are the best among all Indian captains to date.

      Dhoni also holds numerous captaincy records such as the most wins by an
      Indian captain in ODIs and T20Is, and most back-to-back wins by an Indian
      captain in ODIs. He took over the ODI captaincy from Rahul Dravid in 2007
      and led the team to its first-ever bilateral ODI series wins in Sri Lanka
      and New Zealand. In June 2013, when India defeated England in the final of
      the Champions Trophy in England, Dhoni became the first captain to win all
      three ICC limited-overs trophies (World Cup, Champions Trophy and the
      World Twenty20). After taking up the Test captaincy in 2008, he led the
      team to series wins in New Zealand and the West Indies, and the
      <b>Border-Gavaskar Trophy </b>in 2008, 2010 and 2013. In 2009, Dhoni also
      led the

        rankings.</i
